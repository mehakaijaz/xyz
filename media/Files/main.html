                        What is a digital library?<br>
                        A digital library is a collection of digital objects, such as books, magazines, audio recordings, 
						video recordings and other documents that are accessible electronically.
						The content may be stored locally, or accessed remotely.
						Objects can consist of digitized content like print or photographs, 
						as well as originally produced digital content like word processor files or social media posts. 
						In addition to storing content, digital libraries provide means for organizing, searching, and 
						retrieving the content contained in the collection. Digital libraries can vary immensely in size and 
						scope, and can be maintained by individuals or organizations.

					The term virtual library was initially used interchangeably with digital library, 
					but is now primarily used for libraries that are virtual in other senses (such as libraries 
					which aggregate distributed content). In the early days of digital libraries, 
					there was discussion of the similarities and differences among the terms digital,
					 virtual, and electronic.

					<h3>Institutional repositories</h3>
				<p>
					Many academic libraries are actively involved in building repositories of their institution's books, 
					papers, theses, and other works that can be digitized or were 'born digital'. 
					Many of these repositories are made available to the general public with few restrictions, 
					in accordance with the goals of open access, in contrast to the publication of research in 
					commercial journals, where the publishers usually limit access rights. Irrespective of access rights, 
					institutional, truly free, and corporate repositories can be referred to as digital libraries

					Large scale digitization projects are underway at Google, the Million Book Project, and Internet Archive. With continued improvements in book handling and presentation technologies such as optical character recognition and development of alternative depositories and business models, digital libraries are rapidly growing in popularity. Just as libraries have ventured into audio and video collections, so have digital libraries such as the Internet Archive. In 2016, Google Books project received a court victory on proceeding with their book-scanning project that was halted by the Authors' Guild.[47] This helped open the road for libraries to work with Google to better reach patrons who are accustomed to computerized information.<br>
					According to Larry Lannom, Director of Information Management Technology at the nonprofit Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI), "all the problems associated with digital libraries are wrapped up in archiving". He goes on to state, "If in 100 years people can still read your article, we'll have solved the problem." Daniel Akst, author of The Webster Chronicle, proposes that "the future of libraries—and of information—is digital". Peter Lyman and Hal Variant, information scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, estimate that "the world's total yearly production of print, film, optical, and magnetic content would require roughly 1.5 billion gigabytes of storage". Therefore, they believe that "soon it will be 
					technologically possible for an average person to access virtually all recorded information"
